# BattyBirdNET - Bat Sound Analyzer 


## Purpose

The purpose is to assist in the automated classification of bat calls. There are some excellent classifiers out there. However, most are for other animal groups, notably birds, or are limited in their use to researchers. The aim here is to provide a solid classifier for as many regions of the planet as possible that can be built into inexpensive systems for citizen scientists. It builds upon the work of the BirdNET open source product family that has a similar aim for birds. The BirdNET systems are using a sampling frequency that is too low to capture bat echo location calls. So here I use the system at significantly higher sampling rates and cross train a classifier on the BirdNET artificial neural networks to identify bats. Think of a bat as a bird singing three times as fast. Once such a cross trained bat network has the necessary performance, I intend to integrate it into the BirdNET-Pi framework in order to run them 24/7 in self-assembled recoding stations.
You can most definitely already use the bat trained classifier with the analyzer scripts to assist (do not just rely on it for e.g. biodiversity assessments) in identifying bat calls.

## Try online demo at huggingface.co
If you have small (a few seconds) .wav or .flac recordings of bats you can try the online demo. It is hosted on a small
container (2 vcpu) so you need to install your own system (see below) if you want to analyze larger data sets.

https://huggingface.co/spaces/Amazetl/BattyBirdNET-Analyze-Demo

If you are from the UK, you can crosscheck e.g. with batdetect2

https://huggingface.co/spaces/macaodha/batdetect2

## Methods and data
The detection works by transfer learning from the bird detection network BirdNET v2.4. This network operates on 48000Hz and 3 second sampling intervals. This will not work for bats as their calls go much higher in frequency rates. Since the network is designed to identify bird calls it is still usefull for cross training for bat calls once the frequency range is adjusted. There are several realistic candidates for such frequency rates, including

* 144000 Hz at 1 second intervalls - bat sound up to 72kHz considered
* 240000 Hz at 0.6 second intervalls - bat sounds up to 120kHz considered
* 288000 Hz at 0.5 second intervalls - bat sounds uo to 144kHz considered
* 360000 Hz at 0.4 second intervals - bat sounds up to 180kHz considered

All of which seem plausible enough for detecting most European and North American bat species. It depends on the hardware (microphones) available to you and the calls of the bat species in your area. The above combinations arise form the expected input to the BirdNET artificial neural network ( 144000 = 48000 * 3). An advantage that comes with this is that not single calls, but all calls  that occur within a second are used to identify the bat allowing for more context/correlation than many traditional bat classifiers consider. In general there is a trade-off between this context and the frequency range you allow for. The value fo BattyBirdNET is set to a compromise for cost and range of many bat species (20-72kHz).

The data for North American bats comes from the NABAT machine learning data set. The data for Europe was assembled from the Animal Sound Archive Berlin and the ChiroVox databse. It contains echolocation as well as social and distress calls in different quantities for each species.

The cross training / transfer learning itself uses the framework provided by BirdNET-Analyzer originally intended for fine tuneing the model to local bird calls or other wildlife in the human audible range. Essentially, it puts a thin layer of a linear classifier on the output of the BirdNET artificial neural network. Appears to also work for bats if sampling frequencies are adjusted. To cross train your own classifier on top of BirdNET set the config parameters in config.py and run e.g.
```  sh
 python3 train.py --i ../path/to/data --o ./path/to/file-name-you-want.tflite
```
This expects that your training data is contained in subfolders that have the following name structure 'Lantin name_Common name' such as e.g. 'Antrozous pallidus_Pallid bat'. The labels are parsed from the folder names. You can also have folders for 'noise' or 'background'.


## Classifiers
The classifiers are used together with BirdNET to identify the bats. The audio file you provide is resampled to 144kHz and presented to BirdNET in a sequences of one second. It can hence pick up frequencies of up to 144kHz/2  = 72kHz. While this is not as high as bats can go, it captures a large enough range to attempt a first classifcation. The system can also be run at higher frequencies (see methods). Essentially, BirdNET believes that a bird made these one second bat sounds in three seconds. It generates a representation of the audio signal (embedding) which is then taken by the classifiers listed below to identify the bat. The classifier 'knows' that this is a bat and not a bird as BirdNET would believe. 

| Classifier       |  Range      |     Training set size    | Validation loss and precision |
|:-------|:------|:------| :------|
|**EU** | Covers 29 species. |  2200+ calls. | val_loss: 0.0017 - val_prec: 0.9605
|**Bavaria** | Covers 24 species. |  2000+ calls  |  val_loss: 0.0016 - val_prec: 0.9675
|**Sweden** | Covers 18 species. |    |  val_loss: 0.0013 - val_prec: 0.9335
|**USA** | Covers 34 species. | max. 200 calls/species.  |  val_loss: 0.0081 - val_prec: 0.9396
|**MarinCounty** | California |   |  val_loss: 0.0080 - val_prec: 0.9266
|**Scotland** | Covers 10 species. |  1200+ calls. | val_loss: 0.0044 - val_prec: 0.9474
| **UK** | Covers 16 species. | 1500+ calls. | val_loss: 0.0016 - val_prec: 0.9565

Some occasional 'guests' are considered but definitely not all possible ones. The performance of the classifiers depends mostly on the quality and size of the data set used in training. The amount of samples for each species vary. So does the context of the calls. The BattyBirdNETs training data set contains free fly, hunting, social calls, calls during release and in enclosures. The amount of these vary for each species. To avoid overfitting, the classifiers were trained with noise.

You can download the data used for training the EU-144kHz classifiers here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Amazetl/BattyBirdNet-144kHz-v1.0 
The UK, Sweden, Scotland, Bavaria classifiers are trained on subsets of this data set. For the US data, see the lik to the NABAT data site below.

## Install
You can follow the same procedure as for the BirdNET-Analyzer [see here](./README_BIRDNET_ANALYZER.adoc). Just remember to use this repository.

If you want to generate spectrograms, you need to install 'sox' for your platform and make sure it is in your systems PATH variable.

To use the graphical UI, you will need to upse pip3 to install pywebview and gradle.

## Usage
### Clients analyze.py and bat_ident.py
To identify bats, load your audio data into the folder named 'put-your-files-here'. The files can be in .wav (recommended), .flac, .mp3, .ogg or .m4a format.  The analysis is set to standard settings that should work for most by default. If you are fine with the EU classfier and hava python 3.10 version installed (check with python3 --version), then
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py
```
is all you need to do to run an analysis on all autio files in that directory. Results will appear in a 'put-your-files-here/results' folder in .csv format. The audio files are analyzed and for each second one or two potential species are listed. These are the most likely bat species to made made the calls in that second.
You can also use the more verbose analyze.py
``` sh
python3 analyze.py --i put-your-files-here/ --o put-your-files-here/results --classifier checkpoints/bats/v1.0/BattyBirdNET-Bavaria-144kHz.tflite
```
There are several options available, most natably the area setting, e.g.
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py --area Scotland
```
that uses a more area specific subset of bats and hence can reduce some classification erros. You can set the above classifiers via the '--area' flag. Further, you can also set analysis related parameters such as 

``` sh
--min_conf  Minimum confidence threshold. Values in [0.01, 0.99]. Defaults to 0.1. 
--overlap   Overlap of prediction segments. Values in [0.0, 2.9]. Defaults to 0.0. 
--rtype     Specifies output format. Values in ['table', 'audacity', 'r',  'kaleidoscope', 'csv']. 
```
and hardware related parameters
``` sh
--threads    Number of CPU threads.
--batchsize  Number of samples to process at the same time.
```
you can also provide custom input and output dirctories
``` sh
--i  Path to input file or folder.
--o  Path to output file or folder.
```
A more complex example might look like this
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py --location Bavaria --i test_data/Bavaria --o test_data/Bavaria/results --min_conf 0.4 --overlap 0.3
```

### Graphical user interface
Currently single file and batch file analysis are supported with English labels. You need to have pywebview and gradle installed, e.g. by
``` sh
pip3 install pywebview gradle
```
To start the GUI, use
``` sh
python3 bat_gui.py
```
it opens up a window and alternatively, you can use it from your browser on http://127.0.0.1:7860 .
Once you have analysis files, you can use the segmentats tab to extract segments. 

### Extracting identified segments and plotting spectrograms
Once you ran bat_ident.py and have a result file, you can obtain the segmented audio files sorted by detected species using 
``` sh
python3 segments.py --audio path/to/input/audio --results path/to/input/audio/results --o path/to/input/audio/segments
```
If you have put your files in the folder 'put-your-files-here', you can use
``` sh
python3 segments.py
```
If you use the above folder and know that you want to extract the segements at the time you run the analyis, you can use
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py --segment on
```
and it will generate the segments to 'put-your-files-here/segments'. If you have installed the program 'sox' on your system (or sox.exe, a command line tool) and it is in your shells 'Path' variable, you can segment and generate .png images of the corresponding diagramy by using
``` sh
python3 bat_ident.py --spectrum on
```


### REST API - Online service
You can start an API service to analyze your bat calls locally or remotely. You set the area and other parameters once when you start the API service that can then answer http requests
``` sh
python3 server.py --area EU
```
e.g. using the client.py or from your remote/local application
``` sh
python3 client.py --i path/to/audio.wav
```
